We welcome contributions!

## Before you begin

Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/deangelisdf/write2audiobook/issues). Leave a comment in the issue before you
start working on it. This lets the maintainers assign the issue to you and therefore prevent duplicate work from
different contributors.

If you want to suggest a change but can't find it in the open issues list, [open a new issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).
A maintainer will discuss your changes with you and the rest of the contributor community. If you want to make the change,
a maintainer will assign the issue to you.

## How you can contribute

To contribute, [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)

A maintainer will review your submitted changes. If the maintainer approves the changes,
they will merge the changes into the main branch of the repository.
